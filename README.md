## About Passbolt

Passbolt is an open source password manager for teams. It allows you to
securely share and store credentials. For instance, the wifi password of your
office, the administrator password of a router or your organisation's social
media account passwords, all of them can be secured using passbolt.

Passbolt is different from the other password managers because:
- It is primarily designed for teams and not individuals
- It is free & open source
- It is respectful of privacy
- It is based on OpenPGP, a proven cryptographic standard
- It is easy to use for both novices and IT professionals alike
- It is extensible thanks to its RESTful API
