    jsSHA - ChangeLog
-------------------------
2.0.1 (2015-06-25)
=========================
- Fixed major issue with all hashes failing if raw input was a particular size
  (thanks treus!)

2.0.0 (2015-06-13)
=========================
- Completely reworked API to support streaming inputs
- Exceptions now throw Errors instead of strings (thanks jclem!)

1.6.1 (2015-06-25)
=========================
- Fixed issue with SHA-512 family of hashes failing is raw input was a
  particular size

1.6.0 (2015-03-08)
=========================
This marks the last v1.X new feature release.  The API is changing
significantly with upcoming v2.0 to support streaming and it will be too
difficult to support the older API style with new features.

- Added a BYTES input and output format that is a raw byte string
- Fixed broken AMD support (thanks drewcovi!)
- Fixed broken UTF-8 parsing on non-BMP Unicode characters
- Changed array references to remove warnings on Icedove
- Replaced "UTF16" encoding with "UTF16BE" (big endian) and "UTF16LE" (little
  endian) to remove confusion

1.5.1 (2013-12-15)
=========================
- Changed Google Closure Compiler options to produce "strict" compatible code

1.5 (2013-12-15)
=========================
- Added optional numRounds argument to getHash
  - Note: this necessitated removing the hash result caching functionality
- Reduced file size by optimizing internal constants
- Removed charSize input and replaced with encoding to handle Unicode.  NOTE:
  Only Code points up to 0xFFFF are supported.
  - charSize = 16 is effectively replaced by encoding = "UTF16"
  - charSize = 8 was wrong in terms of handling UTF-8 and has been replaced by
    encoding = "UTF8"
- Changed method of referencing "window" to be compatible with WebWorkers,
  Node.js, and AMD (thanks piranna!)

1.42 (2012-12-28)
=========================
- Readded v1.4 Safari patch to support older versions

1.41 (2012-12-23)
=========================
- Fixed incorrect hash issue with Chrome x64 v25 (Dev channel), also provides
  stable patch to v1.4 Safari issue.

1.4 (2012-12-08)
=========================
- Added new input type, TEXT, that is functionally identical to ASCII*
- Added new input type, B64, for base-64 encoded strings
- Added new input and output formatting parameters
  - getHash and getHMAC take an optional parameter, outputFormatOpts,
    that is a hash list containing the keys "outputUpper" (boolean, only
    applicable to HEX output) and "b64Pad" (string, only applicable to Base-64
    output) that have default values of false and "=", respectively
  - jsSHA constructor takes an optional parameter, charSize (8 or 16) that
    specifies the character width of the input (TEXT and ASCII input only)
- Modified comments to be Google Closure Compiler compliant
- Added a SUPPORTED_ALGS flag that, when used with the Google Closure Compiler,
  will remove unused functions/function portions
  - Removed all src/*_nice.js files as the SUPPORTED_ALGS flag renders them
    obsolete
- All production-ready files are now produced using the Google Closure Compiler
  with ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS resulting in further reduced filesizes
- The SHA-1 only implementation now requires that that "SHA-1" be specified as
  the variant when using getHash and getHMAC
- Removed test/HMAC.py as new NIST tests made the need for it obsolete
- Significantly changed the test/test.html to make it easier to understand and
  to allow for easier adding of test cases
- Replaced previous error returning code with thrown exceptions
- Fix for 64-bit Safari issue (thanks Ron Garret and Chris Warren-Smith!)
  - NOTE: While this fix works, it is merely a workaround for a WebKit JavaScript
   optimizer bug, see https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88673 for more detail

* This library misused the term ASCII so input type of TEXT was added with the
  intention of deprecating ASCII

1.31 (2012-07-21)
=========================
- Updated project URL to point to new GitHub repository
- Added a compressed version of sha.js

1.3 (2010-09-01)
=========================
- Changed method of declaring objects/classes
- Moved non-instance specific variables and methods to class scope
- Removed logically correct but unneeded conditionals

1.2 (2009-07-22)
=========================
- Added the HMAC algorithm for all supported hashes (using both ASCII and hex
  keys)
- As a result of adding HMAC, added support for hash input text to be hex
  (ASCII representation of hex)
- Added multiple variants of safeAdd functions, resulting in a significant
  performance gain
- Removed wrapper.js file
- Used a different JavaScript compressor resulting in smaller file sizes

1.11 (2008-12-07)
=========================
- Fixed a base-64 encoding issue resulting from a missing capital 'X'

1.1 (2008-09-25)
=========================
- Fixed an issue with incorrect hashes being generated when jsSHA ojbects were
  used to generate multiple hashes

1.0 (2008-09-25)
=========================
- Made all functions/variables follow an object-orientated methodology
- Removed support for string hash output as the hash is rarely ASCII friendly
- Changed the interface to calculate hashes (see README)
- Made sha.js validate against JSLint (http://www.jslint.com/) using
  "Recommended" settings

0.1 (2008-02-21)
=========================
- Initial public release
