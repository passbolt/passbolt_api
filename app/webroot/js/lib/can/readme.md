> WARNING: This npm package is for the [CanJS client-side MV* framework](http://canjs.com). It was formerly
the [node-can project](https://github.com/sebi2k1/node-can) which has been moved 
to [socketcan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socketcan). A HUGE thanks to Sebastian Haas for 
letting us use the `can` name!

> NOTE: The `canjs` NPM package name is deprecated. Use `can` instead.

CanJS is a MIT-licensed, client-side, JavaScript framework that makes building 
rich web applications easy. Use it because it’s:

- Smaller 
- Faster 
- Safer 
- Easier 
- Library-er
