The Image Helper
================

The plugin comes with an Image helper that makes it easy to display the images generated by the ImageStorage model and the events that process the images.

This helper is the best added to your ```AppController```.

```php
class AppController extends Controller {
	$helpers = array(
		'FileStorage.Image'
	);
}
````

In your views you can now access all your image versions, which you have declared before in your config, through the helper.

```php
echo $this->Image->display($product['Image'], 'small');
```

If you want to get only the URL to an image you can call ```imageUrl()```.

```php
$imageUrl = $this->Image->imageUrl($product['Image'], 'small');
echo $this->Html->image($imageUrl);
```

Options for display() and imageUrl()
------------------------------------

The third argument of both methods is an option array, right now it has only one option to set.

* **fallback:** Optional, can be boolean true or string. If boolean true it will use ```placeholder/<YOUR-VERSION>.jpg``` as place  holder. If string it will use that as image.
